The game uses 164 cards, 144 cards representing
the numbers 0 to 12 and 18 Wild Jokers. 
The object of the game is to be the first to use all the cards from his Stock Pile.
Cards are played onto the Building Piles in increasing order, from 1 to 12.
Jokers are used as wild cards. Each pile must be started with a "1" or a Joker.
When a "12" is played onto a Building pile, the pile is removed and the space can
be used to start a new pile.
After the stock cards are dealt, each player plays in turn.
A turn starts with a player being dealt enough cards until 5 cards are in his Hand.
Then the player has to try to use cards from his Hand or cards previously discarded
onto his own Discard Piles so that he can be able to play the top card of his Stock Pile.
When this card is played, the next card from the Stock pile is turned face up.
Cards can only be played onto the Building Piles using the next card in sequence or a Joker.
Only the top cards from the Discard Piles can be played. The player can continually play
until he can't play anymore, at which time he has to discard a card onto one of his Discard
piles and his turn is over.
If a player uses up all of the cards from his Hand, he will be dealt another 5 cards
to play with.
